Madam, Sir, 

Here is my research project website "AI, Ethics and Cognitive Personality: Can Large Language Model steal my personality... or be worse ?"



This project explores how large language models (LLMs) make moral decisions compared to humans. It combines Big Five personality traits, the peer-reviewed CNI model to analyse morality and AI generated agents facing standardized moral dilemmas. 

Here is the link: https://lll-personality-and-moral-dilemma.onrender.com


Main files:

app.py – Flask app and routes for the web interface

templates/ – HTML templates for context, data/methods, results, and report pages

static/ – CSS and images (plots, icons, etc.)

data/ – CSV files with human and artificial CNI parameters and personality scores


Don't hesitate to ask any question !
