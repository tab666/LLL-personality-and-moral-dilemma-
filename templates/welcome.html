      text: "You are a construction worker on the construction site for a new high-rise of a wealthy and powerful investor. The man is known to increase his wealth by dubious practices. Specifically, he is hiring people to set buildings on fire, so that he can evict tenants and convert the buildings into luxury properties. In several cases, tenants were seriously injured or killed, but prosecutors have been unable to convict him. While you and the man are on top of the building, you see an opportunity to shove him off the building. The building is high enough for the man to die, which would prevent him from causing more harm to innocent tenants. No one is around to see what is happening and his death would look like an accident. Is it acceptable in this case to shove the man off the roof?",
