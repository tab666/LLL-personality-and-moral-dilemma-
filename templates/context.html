      <h2>AI, personality and Ethics</h2>
      <p>
        With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMS), many studies have
        already been conducted on their behavior when facing ethical dilemmas.
        However, the link between personality and moral values had not yet been
        used to evaluate a LLM behavior - that's when I come in !

      <h2>My research objectives and their evolution during the semester</h2>
      <p>
        At the beginning I was quite disorganized. My research englobed many question: <strong>How well can a LLM replicate a human personality? Do individual personaity traits impact differenly the morality of an AI agent? How well each individual AI agent imitate the answers of its human counterpart?</strong> 
        These question were very interesting and I did explore them but I decided to organize the results in sub-studies I will add to my project in time.  
      </p>
      <p>So my unique research question is:</p>

 <article class="content-block highlight">
      <h2>Can Large Language
        Models, when given human personality traits, reproduce their morality
        reasoning bias?</h2>
